## Load Overview
- **One Table for Loads:** All loads are stored and managed in a single table.
- **Multiple Pick-Up Locations:** A load can have multiple origins where cargo is picked up.
- **Multiple Delivery Locations:** A load can also have multiple destinations for delivery.

## Load Stages

### Load Created / Scheduled
- **Scenario:** The shipper schedules a load for pick-up.
- **Details:** All necessary information about the load (pick-up/delivery locations, weight, type of cargo, etc.) is entered into the system, and the shipment is assigned to a driver/truck.

### Load Confirmed
- **Scenario:** The carrier confirms the assignment.
- **Details:** Once the driver accepts the assignment, the load is confirmed for pick-up.

### Truck Dispatched
- **Scenario:** The truck is dispatched to the pick-up location.
- **Details:** The driver receives instructions, and the system updates the load status to show that the truck is en route to the pick-up.

### At Pick-Up Location
- **Scenario:** The driver arrives at the pick-up location.
- **Details:** The system tracks the driver’s arrival at the origin location.

### Loading in Progress
- **Scenario:** Cargo is being loaded onto the truck.
- **Details:** The load status is updated to show the loading process, with potential for real-time updates (e.g., 50% loaded).

### Load Picked Up
- **Scenario:** Cargo is successfully loaded, and the driver departs.
- **Details:** The load status changes to "In Transit" with the estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the delivery destination.

### In Transit
- **Scenario:** The truck is en route to the delivery destination.
- **Details:** The system tracks the location of the truck in real-time (if using GPS) and provides updates on the estimated delivery time.

### At Delivery Location
- **Scenario:** The driver arrives at the delivery point.
- **Details:** The system updates the status to reflect the driver’s arrival at the destination.

### Unloading in Progress
- **Scenario:** The cargo is being unloaded.
- **Details:** Similar to the loading phase, the system shows the progress of the unloading process.

### Load Delivered
- **Scenario:** The cargo is fully delivered and handed over to the recipient.
- **Details:** The load status is updated to "Delivered," and proof of delivery (POD) is captured, either via electronic signature or other documentation.

### Load Completed
- **Scenario:** All processes related to the delivery, such as paperwork and payments, are finalized.
- **Details:** The load is officially marked as completed, and records are updated in the system.

### Load Delayed
- **Scenario:** If the driver faces delays, such as traffic or mechanical issues, this status can update the load.
- **Details:** The delay is recorded in the system, and updates are sent to stakeholders.

### Load Canceled
- **Scenario:** In case the load is canceled before pick-up or in transit.
- **Details:** The system updates the load to reflect cancellation, and notifications are sent to all relevant parties.

## Additional Information

### Load Attributes
- **Load ID**: A unique identifier for each load.
- **Origin and Destination**: Detailed addresses for multiple pick-up and delivery locations.
- **Type of Cargo**: Specific cargo details (e.g., refrigerated, hazardous, oversized).
- **Weight & Dimensions**: Weight, dimensions, and volume of the cargo.
- **Load Priority**: Urgent, expedited, or regular deliveries.
- **Special Instructions**: Any additional instructions for handling (e.g., temperature control, fragile items).

### Tracking & Notifications
- **Real-time GPS Tracking**: Track the truck's location from pick-up to delivery, showing progress on a map.
- **ETA Updates**: Dynamic calculation of estimated time of arrival (ETA), considering road conditions and delays.
- **Status Notifications**: Automated notifications for key stages (dispatch, pick-up, in transit, delivery, etc.) to shippers, drivers, and customers via SMS or email.

### Load Documentation
- **Bill of Lading (BOL)**: Generate, manage, and store the Bill of Lading.
- **Proof of Delivery (POD)**: Upload and manage POD documents with options for electronic signatures or image capture.
- **Customs Documentation**: For international loads, manage customs-related paperwork and documentation.

### Load Costing & Pricing
- **Freight Charges**: Add dynamic freight calculation based on distance, weight, fuel costs, and other variables.
- **Rate Agreements**: Manage rate agreements with shippers or brokers.
- **Accessorial Charges**: Track and apply additional charges (e.g., detention, layover, loading fees).
- **Cost Allocation**: Allocate costs per mile, per driver, or by fuel consumption to keep detailed cost records.

### Load Optimization & Efficiency
- **Route Optimization**: Suggest optimal routes based on real-time traffic, road conditions, and toll costs.
- **Multi-stop Optimization**: For loads with multiple pick-ups and deliveries, optimize the order in which locations are visited to save time and fuel.
- **Load Matching**: Automatically match loads with available drivers based on truck type, proximity, and load capacity.

### Driver Management
- **Driver Assignment History**: Track the assignment history of drivers per load.
- **Driver Rating System**: Allow shippers to rate drivers based on performance, reliability, and delivery success.
- **Driver Hours of Service (HOS)**: Monitor driver hours to ensure compliance with regulations.

### Load Delays & Exceptions
- **Delay Reasons**: Track specific reasons for delays (traffic, weather, mechanical failure, etc.).
- **Exception Management**: Manage exceptions such as damaged cargo, missed pick-up/delivery, or failed deliveries.
- **Incident Reporting**: Provide a mechanism for drivers to report incidents, accidents, or issues in real-time.

### Load History & Reporting
- **Load History**: Track historical data for each load, including status changes, delays, driver notes, and more.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze load performance metrics such as on-time deliveries, transit times, and fuel efficiency.
- **Reports**: Generate reports for shippers, carriers, or internal use, covering key data like load history, billing, delays, and delivery success rates.

### Communication & Collaboration
- **Integrated Messaging System**: Allow drivers, dispatchers, and shippers to communicate directly within the platform, exchanging real-time updates or instructions.
- **Issue Resolution**: Provide real-time issue management for cargo problems, delays, or route deviations.
- **Customer Portal**: Create a customer-facing portal where clients can track their loads and receive updates.

### Load Security
- **Cargo Insurance Information**: Track cargo insurance details for each load.
- **Security Protocols**: Define security measures for high-value cargo, including geo-fencing alerts if a truck leaves a predefined route.
- **Tamper Alerts**: Alert the system if the cargo is tampered with or if unauthorized access is attempted.

### Integration with External Systems
- **TMS/ERP Integration**: Integrate with external Transportation Management Systems (TMS) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to streamline operations.
- **API for Third-Party Access**: Provide APIs for third-party shippers, brokers, and carriers to connect and manage loads.
- **ELD Integration**: Integrate with electronic logging devices (ELDs) to automatically update driver hours and truck status.

### Load Scheduling & Capacity Planning
- **Future Load Scheduling**: Allow shippers to schedule loads far in advance.
- **Capacity Planning**: Help fleet managers and shippers predict and plan for future load demand, optimizing truck availability and load assignments.

### Sustainability and Compliance
- **Carbon Emission Tracking**: Track fuel consumption and calculate carbon emissions per load for sustainability reporting.
- **Compliance
